Equations are rendered by [Mathjax](https://www.mathjax.org/) to SVGs. Equations can be either inline or displayed. The Markdown syntax for these equation types is given in the table below.

| Equation type         | Code              | Example           |
| -------------         |:-------------:    | -----:            |
| Inline equation       | `\\(...\\)`       | `\\( M = Ax\\)`   |
| Displayed equation    | `\\[...\\]`       | `\\[ M = Ax\\]`   |
| Displayed equation    | `$$...$$`         | `$$ M = Ax$$`     |
