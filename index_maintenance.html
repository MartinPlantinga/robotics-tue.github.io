<h1>Introduction</h1>
This section describes how this website is structured and gives guidelines to maintain it.<br><br>
This website has been created with <a href="https://pages.github.com">Github pages</a>and is hosted on <a href="http://www.github.com">github.com</a>. It uses <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll's platform</a> to transform text files into HTML websites. This allows the users to focus on the content, rather than on the site's source code. Pages are written in the very simple Markdown language (and can also include snippets of HTML).
